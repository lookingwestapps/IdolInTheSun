# Ignore rules for perforce
#
# Free for general use but provided "as is".
# I would recommend keeping this file in your Perforce server folder so you'll know where to find it. Should you make any changes, simply run
# the perforce command to set the ignore file:
#
# p4 set P4IGNORE=C:\Full\Path\To\File\p4Ignore.txt (please use your path format of your OS)
#
#
# FILE TYPES
#
# These are global unless a directory is specified. Please note paths are how your flavor of OS understands.
# To include a specific file of a group of blanket ignored files use the ! symbol.
#
# Example:
# *.html
# !readme.html
# This is essentially like saying "Ignore all files with extension of.html EXCEPT readme.html"
#

# Ignore some Visual Studio stuff as well as log files UE4 writes to when building.
*.sdf
*.sln
*.suo
*.log

#
# FOLDERS
#
# Please be sure to use full paths when possible.
#
# C:\Example\Folder <- This will exclude all files in the folder named Folder (and below).
